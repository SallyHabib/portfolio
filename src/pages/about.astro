  <p>
    Hey! I'm a <strong>Senior Frontend Engineer</strong> who is passionate about creating exceptional user experiences through 
    modern web technologies. I specialize in building accessible, performant, and maintainable user interfaces that make a 
    real difference for users and businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work primarily with <strong>React and TypeScript</strong>, leveraging modern tools like <strong>React Query</strong> 
    for efficient data fetching, <strong>Redux Saga</strong> for state management, and <strong>React Aria</strong> for 
    accessibility compliance. I'm experienced with <strong>Material UI</strong>, <strong>Styled Components</strong>, and 
    have led major migrations including upgrading codebases to <strong>React 19</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond feature development, I'm passionate about mentoring junior engineers through code reviews and knowledge sharing. 
    I believe in writing RFCs for technical decisions, maintaining high code quality with tools like SonarCube, and ensuring 
    our applications are accessible to all users following WCAG standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a <strong>BS in Media Engineering and Technology</strong> from the German University in Cairo and am 
    <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong>.
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, I enjoy travelling, cooking, inventing new recipes and chill.
  </p>
